# purpose
the information in the following files should be used in the code review process. Code review occurs after code has been implemented, and before a pull-request is created to merge the code in to the main branch.

`git status` is available to list all of the recently modified files and should be used to focus the review. The result of `git status` can include staged files, non-staged files, and files that are not tracked; the code review should consider all of the files.

# files to process
for the task for code review, use the following relatative directories to locate a README.md in each directory and read each file listed in each readme.
* `/coding`
